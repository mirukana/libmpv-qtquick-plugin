    \brief A convenience type for playing a specified media content.

    \c MpvPlayer is a libmpv wrapper for Qt Quick. It can be easily
    embeded into any Qt Quick GUI applications.

    \qml
    MpvPlayer {
        id: mpvPlayer

        width : 800
        height : 600

        source: "video.avi"

        MouseArea {
            anchors.fill: parent
            onClicked: mpvPlayer.play()
        }

        focus: true
        Keys.onSpacePressed: mpvPlayer.isPlaying() ? mpvPlayer.pause() : mpvPlayer.play()
        Keys.onLeftPressed: mpvPlayer.seek(-5)
        Keys.onRightPressed: mpvPlayer.seek(5)
    }
    \endqml

    Notes

    \list
    \li Do \b NOT try to interact with the C++ class directly. Just do everything
        you want through this QML type.
    \li \c MpvPlayer is just a simple wrapper of the QML type \c MpvObject. You can
        also use \c MpvObject directly if you want. It's usage is exactly the same
        with \c MpvPlayer.
    \li To get the best performance, try \c ANGLE. Using desktop OpenGL is also fine
        but it's performance will not be as good as ANGLE. Never use \c {Mesa llvmpipe}
        unless you are running your applications in virtual machines.
    \li The default OpenGL version that Qt uses is \c 2.0, which I think is kind of
        out-dated, you can use a newer version instead. However, don't use any versions
        newer than \c 3.1 if you are using ANGLE, because ANGLE doesn't support OpenGL
        versions newer than 3.1.
    \li The official libmpv package only provides a shared library, however, you can
        compile it yourself to get the static library. Static linking is possible,
        see how \c bomi does. Goto shinchiro's repository to see how to compile it.
    \li Qt will load the QML plugins automatically if you have installed them into their
        correct locations, you don't need to load them manually (and to be honest I don't
        know how to load them manually either).

        \c auto tries to automatically enable hardware decoding using the first available method.
        This still depends what VO you are using. For example, if you are not using \c --vo=gpu
        or \c --vo=vdpau, vdpau decoding will never be enabled. Also note that if the first found
        method doesn't actually work, it will always fall back to software decoding, instead of
        trying the next method (might matter on some Linux systems).

        \c auto-copy selects only modes that copy the video data back to system memory after decoding.
        This selects modes like \c vaapi-copy (and so on). If none of these work, hardware decoding
        is disabled. This mode is always guaranteed to incur no additional loss compared to software
        decoding, and will allow CPU processing with video filters.

        The \c vaapi mode, if used with \c --vo=gpu, requires Mesa 11 and most likely works with
        Intel GPUs only. It also requires the opengl EGL backend.

        The \c cuda and \c cuda-copy modes provides deinterlacing in the decoder which is useful as there
        is no other deinterlacing mechanism in the gpu output path. To use this deinterlacing you
        must pass the option: \c vd-lavc-o=deint=[weave|bob|adaptive]. Pass \c weave (or leave the option
        unset) to not attempt any deinterlacing. \c cuda should always be preferred unless the \c gpu vo
        is not being used or filters are required.

        \c nvdec is a newer implementation of CUVID/CUDA decoding, which uses the FFmpeg decoders for
        file parsing. Experimental, is known not to correctly check whether decoding is supported by
        the hardware at all. Deinterlacing is not supported. Since this uses FFmpeg's codec parsers,
        it is expected that this generally causes fewer issues than \c cuda.

        Most video filters will not work with hardware decoding as they are primarily implemented on
        the CPU. Some exceptions are \c vdpaupp, \c vdpaurb and \c vavpp.

        The \c ...-copy modes (e.g. \c dxva2-copy) allow you to use hardware decoding with any VO,
        backend or filter. Because these copy the decoded video back to system RAM, they're likely less
        efficient than the direct modes (like e.g. \c dxva2), and probably not more efficient than
        software decoding except for some codecs (e.g. HEVC).

        Hardware decoding is \b disabled by default. You will have to enable it
        manually if you want to use it.

        \header
            \li Driver name
            \li Brief description
        \row
            \li xv (X11 only)
            \li Uses the XVideo extension to enable hardware-accelerated display.
                This is the most compatible VO on X, but may be low-quality, and
                has issues with OSD and subtitle display.
        \row
            \li x11 (X11 only)
            \li Shared memory video output driver without hardware acceleration
                that works whenever X11 is present.
        \row
            \li vdpau (X11 only)
            \li Uses the VDPAU interface to display and optionally also decode
                video. Hardware decoding is used with \c --hwdec=vdpau.
        \row
            \li direct3d (Windows only)
            \li Video output driver that uses the Direct3D interface.
        \row
            \li gpu
            \li General purpose, customizable, GPU-accelerated video output driver.
                It supports extended scaling methods, dithering, color management,
                custom shaders, HDR, and more.
        \row
            \li sdl
            \li SDL 2.0+ Render video output driver, depending on system with or
                without hardware acceleration. Should work on all platforms supported
                by SDL 2.0. For tuning, refer to your copy of the file \c SDL_hints.h.
        \row
            \li vaapi
            \li Intel VA API video output driver with support for hardware decoding.
                Note that there is absolutely no reason to use this, other than
                compatibility. This is low quality, and has issues with OSD.
        \row
            \li null
            \li Produces no video output. Useful for benchmarking.
        \row

        \row
            \li tct
            \li Color Unicode art video output driver that works on a text console.
                Depends on support of true color by modern terminals to display the
                images at full color range. On Windows it requires an ansi terminal
                such as mintty.
        \row

            \li Output each frame into an image file in the current directory. Each

        \row
            \li libmpv
            \li For use with libmpv direct embedding. As a special case, on OS X it
                is used like a normal VO within mpv (cocoa-cb). Otherwise useless in
                any other contexts. (See \c <mpv/render.h>.)
                This also supports many of the options the \c gpu VO has, depending
                on the backend.
        \row
            \li drm (Direct Rendering Manager)
            \li Video output driver using Kernel Mode Setting / Direct Rendering Manager.
                Should be used when one doesn't want to install full-blown graphical
                environment (e.g. no X). Does not support hardware acceleration (if you
                need this, check the \c drm backend for \c gpu VO).
        \row
            \li mediacodec_embed (Android)
            \li Renders \c IMGFMT_MEDIACODEC frames directly to an \c android.view.Surface.
                Requires \c --hwdec=mediacodec for hardware decoding, along with
                \c --vo=mediacodec_embed and \c --wid=(intptr_t)(*android.view.Surface).
                Since this video output driver uses native decoding and rendering routines,
                many of mpv's features (subtitle rendering, OSD/OSC, video filters, etc)
                are not available with this driver.

        Note that the accuracy of these properties is influenced by a few factors.
        If the underlying demuxer rewrites the packets on demuxing (done for some file
